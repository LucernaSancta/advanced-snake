# Walls Usage docs

Walls are more than just barriers, they shape the level and influence gameplay.

## What Walls Do
- Define the playable boundaries (both visual and collision-based)
- Load optional level-specific walls from a map file
- Use tile-aware rendering to make things look smooth and connected

## Want to Edit or Add Walls?
You can customize walls using a simple CSV file:

- Location: maps/
- Format:
```
x,y
5,10
6,10
7,10
```
- Each entry adds a wall tile at `(x * tile_width, y * tile_height)`
- Change the `WALLS_MAP` variable in the `config.toml` file to the name of your CSV file

## Wall Textures
You can swap out how the walls look by adding a texture file and changing the `config.toml` file accordingly.
