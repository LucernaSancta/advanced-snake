# 🍓 Custom Food Textures

## ⚙️ How It Works
Food textures are loaded dynamically from:
```
textures/food/
```
When an apple is created, it:

- Loads the image by filename
- Automatically scales it to the right size
- Draws it directly at its in-game position

👉 There’s no tile grid, no layout rules, just one image per food.

## 🧑‍🎨 Image Guidelines
- Any shape or size works — it's scaled for you
- Transparent PNGs are supported
- Keep the aspect ratio `1:1` (e.g. 64×64)
- Center your design — it’s placed as-is on the game grid

## 🎨 Example Custom Textures
- Create a new PNG (suggested: 64×64)
- Draw your food item
- Save to `textures/food/` with whatever name you like

## 📥 Load a Custom Texture
To load a custom food texture you can just change the `textures.apples` variable in the `config.toml` file to the name of the texture's file.

Example:
```toml
[textures]
apples = "custom.png"
```
