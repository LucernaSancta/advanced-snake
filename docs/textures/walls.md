# Walls textures docs

## How They Work
- Each texture is a 4×4 tile grid.
- Each tile corresponds to a wall piece depending on how it connects to its neighbors (like corners, sides, junctions).
- The system auto-selects the right tile based on adjacency — so you only need to provide a clean texture sheet.

## Image Rules
- Must be a PNG file
- Must be a square image (1:1 ratio)
- Must contain 16 tiles, laid out in a 4×4 grid
- Each tile must be equally sized
- Transparent backgrounds work great (for rounded or styled walls)

For example:

- 128×128 → 32×32 tiles
- 256×256 → 64×64 tiles
- 512×512 → 128×128 tiles

You can scale up or down, just keep that grid clean.

## Where to Put Them
- All wall textures live in:
```
textures/walls/
```
- Default used: `default.png`

You can swap textures in the `WALLS_DEFAULT_TEXTURES` variable of the `config.toml`

## Tips for custom textures
- Try starting from `default.png` as a template, then recolor, reshape, or stylize as you like.
- Keep alignment clean: Make sure edges line up perfectly across tiles.

## Testing
To simplify the texture creation process we created a map (`testing.csv`) that uses all walls textures
